# SwiftUI-Calculator
A basic, *functional calculator built using SwiftUI - lots of room for expansion and improvement

//
I am currently altering all of the code here to use a more convenient method of converting strings/characters
into numbers and back again. I am also switching this to use a cleaner MVC structure because as it is I can't 
stand looking at it
//


There are lots of documents available detailing how to clone the UI of Apple's built-in calculator.
That design has remained nearly (completely?) unchanged since the launch of the Ipod Touch. 

I left out pretty much all of the UI code because I don't see the point in cloning Apple's products. 
However, the logic for taking a String and converting that String into an expression is not quite as simple or as common. 

*Normally I wouldn't bother uploading something like this, but seeing as how difficult it was for me to find accessible resources
on the subject, it seemed important. I've tinkered with what I could find, but there is a bug in the expressionValue() function, which needs fixed. 

Hopefully this will make someone else's life easier.
